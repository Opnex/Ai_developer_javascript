## ðŸŽ¯ Practice Exercise 1

**Task:** Array Basics - Shopping List  

**Requirements:**  
1. Create an array `shoppingList` with at least 5 items  
2. Add a new item to the end of the list  
3. Remove the first item from the list  
4. Display the total number of items  
5. Loop through the list and print each item with its position  

**Challenge:**  
Create a function `formatList(list)` that returns the shopping list in a numbered format (1. Item, 2. Item, ...).



## ðŸŽ¯ Practice Exercise 2

**Task:** Student Grades Analyzer  

**Requirements:**  
1. Store grades in an array  
2. Write a function `getAverage(grades)` to calculate average grade  
3. Write a function `getHighest(grades)` to find the highest grade  
4. Write a function `getLowest(grades)` to find the lowest grade  
5. Use loops where necessary to process the array  

**Challenge:**  
Create a function `getPassRate(grades)` that:  
- Counts how many students scored **50 or above** (passing)  
- Divides that number by the total number of students  
- Returns the **percentage of students who passed** 





## ðŸŽ¯ Practice Exercise 3

**Task:** Movie Ratings System  

**Requirements:**  
1. Create two arrays: `movies` (names) and `ratings` (numbers)  
2. Write a function `addMovie(movie, rating)` that adds a new entry  
3. Write a function `getAverageRating()` to calculate the average rating  
4. Write a function `getTopMovie()` to find the highest-rated movie  
5. Print a summary of all movies with their ratings  

**Challenge:**  
Sort the movies by rating (highest â†’ lowest) and display the sorted list.

### Comprehensive Practice Exercise: Student Report System

Build a program that manages student grades using arrays, loops, and functions.

**Your Challenge:**  
Create a system with multiple functions that can:

1. **Add Student** - Store student names and their grades in an array  
2. **Calculate Average** - Compute the average grade for the class  
3. **Find Top & Bottom Student** - Identify the student with the highest and lowest score  
4. **Grade Categorizer** - Assign letter grades (A, B, C, D, F) based on numeric scores  
5. **Report Generator** - Print a formatted class report showing:  
   - Each studentâ€™s name, grade, and letter grade  
   - Class average  
   - Top student  
   - Lowest student  

**Requirements:**  
- Use arrays to store multiple students  
- Use `for` or `for...of` loops to process data  
- Write at least 5 reusable functions  
- Validate inputs (no negative grades, no grades above 100)  
- Use `Math.max()` and `Math.min()` for comparisons  
- Return results in a well-formatted way (like a table or list)  

**Challenge:**  
Sort the students by grade (highest â†’ lowest) before printing the report.
