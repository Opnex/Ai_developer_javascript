    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hello, I’m <strong>Thomas Opeyemi Stephen</strong>, a passionate and dedicated individual with a keen interest in web development, design, and technology. 
      I enjoy creating solutions that combine creativity with functionality, and I’m always eager to learn and explore new ideas.
    </p>

      Beyond work, I value growth, collaboration, and sharing knowledge with others. My journey so far has been fueled by curiosity, perseverance, and the belief that every challenge is an opportunity to improve.

      When I’m not working, you’ll find me reading, building projects, or exploring new tools. My goal is to keep developing my skills while contributing positively to every project I’m involved in.
